# Bank Loan Report 
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Bank Loan Report project. 
The project aims to create comprehensive reports and visualizations to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance. 
By analyzing key loan-related metrics and trends, we aim to make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify strategies for enhancing our lending operations.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main components: Summary Dashboard, Overview Dashboard, and Details Dashboard. Each dashboard focuses on different aspects of our lending operations and provides insights through various visualizations and metrics.

1. Summary Dashboard
The Summary Dashboard provides an overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications, funded amounts, amount received, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. It also includes metrics for distinguishing between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria.

2. Overview Dashboard
The Overview Dashboard presents critical loan-related metrics and trends through a variety of chart types, including line charts, filled maps, donut charts, bar charts, and tree maps. These visualizations offer insights into monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term analysis, employee length analysis, loan purpose breakdown, and home ownership analysis.

3. Details Dashboard
The Details Dashboard offers a consolidated view of essential loan data, providing users with comprehensive insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance. It serves as a user-friendly interface for accessing detailed information efficiently.
